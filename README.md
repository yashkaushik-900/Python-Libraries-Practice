📚 Tools & Libraries Practiced

This project showcases my ability to work across Python, Excel, and Power BI to perform end-to-end data analysis and deliver actionable insights.

🐍 Python Libraries

Pandas – Data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and analysis.

NumPy – Numerical computations and array manipulations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization, trend analysis, and statistical charts.

SciPy – Advanced statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

Scikit-learn – Machine learning, predictive modeling, and evaluation.

SQLAlchemy / SQLite3 – Database connections, queries, and data ingestion.

Logging & OS – Workflow automation, debugging, and system-level operations.

📊 Excel

Pivot Tables for summarizing vendor performance.

Advanced formulas (VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, IF, Nested functions) for calculations.

Conditional Formatting to highlight key trends.

Data Cleaning tools (Remove Duplicates, Text-to-Columns, Power Query).

Charts (Bar, Line, Combo, Histogram) for quick insights.

📈 Power BI

Data Modeling with multiple tables (Sales, Purchases, Vendors).

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated measures (Profit Margin %, Sales-to-Purchase Ratio).

Interactive Dashboards with slicers, drill-through, and filters.

KPI Cards for quick business metrics.

Publishing and sharing reports for decision-making.

💡 With this stack, I can handle the complete data workflow:
Data Collection → Cleaning → Analysis → Visualization → Business Insights → Reporting

This README reflects my hands-on practice in building solutions that combine programming, analytics, and business intelligence to solve real-world problems.
